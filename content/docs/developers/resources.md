## Learn Solidity
Solidity is a programming language for writing DeFi applications. The Solidity programs are compiled
and uploaded to Reef chain, where they run in a completely decentralized fashion.

Here are some great resources for learning Solidity:
 - The [official Solidity docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org)
 - Solidity [tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/solidity/index.htm) for programmers


Compiling, deploying and managing Solidity smart contracts by hand can be a chore. For this reason
we have developer frameworks for Python and JS/TypeScript.

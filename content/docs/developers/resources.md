## Reef Chain

### Developer Console
You can connect to the developer UI for different networks:

[Mainnet](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc.reefscan.com%2Fws#/explorer) | [Testnet](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Frpc-testnet.reefscan.com%2Fws#/explorer) | [Local Node](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A9944#/explorer)


{{< alert icon="ðŸ’¡" text="If you are opening the developer console for the first time you will need to setup Types and Metadata." >}}


The `types.json` file for the block explorer UI can be found [here](https://github.com/reef-defi/reef-chain/blob/master/assets/types.json).

To set the types.json go to Developer > Settings. [example](https://i.imgur.com/ShfG9v7.png)

The metadata syncing with the [Polkadot browser extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/) will be offered to you automatically. Just click accept.

### Block explorer
The block explorer for all Reef chain networks is available at `reefscan.com`:

[Mainnet](https://reefscan.com) | [Testnet](https://testnet.reefscan.com)


### EVM Playground
You can deploy and interact with smart contracts via EVM Playground UI:
[https://evm.reefscan.com](https://evm.reefscan.com)


## DeFi

### Learn Solidity
Solidity is a programming language for writing DeFi applications. The Solidity programs are compiled
and uploaded to Reef chain, where they run in a completely decentralized fashion.

Here are some great resources for learning Solidity:
 - The [official Solidity docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org)
 - Solidity [tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/solidity/index.htm) for programmers


Compiling, deploying and managing Solidity smart contracts by hand can be a chore. For this reason
we have developer frameworks for Python and JS/TypeScript.

### Reef for JS/TypeScript devs
Javascript developers can use our [HardHat integration](https://github.com/reef-defi/hardhat-reef) to develop and deploy smart contracts on Reef chain.

### Reef for Python devs
Reef ecosystem for Python is coming soon.


## Reef Node

### Reef node commands
Here is a quick cheat-sheet with some of the most commonly used commands on the Reef node.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ’¡" text="To see all commands and their documentation run <b>./reef-node help</b>" >}}

### Compile the node
If you haven't yet, compile the Reef node locally:
```
make build && cd target/release
```

### Start the local development node
```
./reef-node \
  --chain dev \
  --base-path /tmp/reefnode \
  --port 30333 \
  --ws-port 9944 \
  --rpc-port 9933 \
  --rpc-methods Auto \
  --rpc-cors all \
  --rpc-external \
  --ws-external \
  --name MyNode
```

### Reset the local chain
To prune (reset) the node run:
```
./target/release/reef-node purge-chain --chain dev
```

### Generate a keypair
You can follow the [accounts](/docs/developers/accounts/#generate-a-keypair) guide on how to use the CLI to make new keypairs.

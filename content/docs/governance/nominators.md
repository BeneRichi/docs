### Who is it for?
Anyone interested in Reef chain governance can become a Nominator. The main responsibility of Nominators is to vote for and elect competent Validators (block producers).

Nominators are rewarded with part of the revenue share generated by the Validators. However in the event that the Validator misbehaves, Nominators can lose their bonded stake.

### Bonding
The first step towards becoming a nominator is bonding (staking) Reef tokens.
